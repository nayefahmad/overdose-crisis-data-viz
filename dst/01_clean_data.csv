The INSPECT program aims to provide information storage for healthcare professionals and provide a central database with the dispensing information of schedule II, III, IV and V drugs and the patient information of the user without interfering with physician's prescribing of drugs to patients that need them. The program allows law enforcement to use the data to investigate drug abuse and also allows sharing of data with prescription monitoring programs of other states to reduce substance users from doctor shopping in other states. The outcomes assessed are the outcomes of the program, but the article focuses on ways to  improve the program so that it can reach its full potential and achieve improved outcomes.",2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Pharmacists,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0

The article outlines the culpability exception to the wrongful conduct rule which means plaintiffs (i.e. someone who uses OxyContin who is charged with a crime) can sue the defendant (i.e. a negligent doctor or pharmacist who dispensed the OxyContin) because both the plaintiff and defendant engaged in illegal acts and the defendants culpability is greater than the plaintiff's culpability for injuries. Basically, people who are struggling with an OxyContin addiction who are charged with a crime are allowed to sue and seek damages from the doctors and/or pharmacists who was negligent and contributed to the addiction.",2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0

Russoniello_2012,data_extraction_arm_1,NA,NA,3,Tanis,Colleen,2012,0,NA,0,NA,2,NA,0,0,"The article outlines decriminalization of drug possession in Portugal and Mexico and argues that Mexico's decriminalization of the possession of small amounts of drugs will not be able to achieve the same positive result seen in Portugal. Mexico's law Against Small-Scale Drug Dealing imposes no criminal penalties for possession of a small amount of drugs, but it doesn't protect the drug users rights nor does it take an effective public health approach. The law also increases penalties for possession of larger quantities of drugs, which aligns with criminalizing and incarceration of drug users. The article argues that Mexico's decriminalization focuses too much on criminal justice and needs to be abandoned for a public health approach in order to see a positive result. The article basically argues that Mexico needs to use Portugal's decriminalization scheme in order to be successful and provides specific examples of what Mexico needs to change to truly decriminalize and potential challenges Mexico may face in the process.",2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0
