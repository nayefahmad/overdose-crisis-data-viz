Questions to help determine study design:

1. Single study or a search/synthesis of multiple studies?
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. Multiple => systematic or scoping review
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Single study => go to next question

2. Experimental or observational study?
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. Experimental => randomized controlled trial
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Observational => go to next question

3. Unit of analysis?
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. Group or population-level => Ecological study
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp i. If looking at time trends or 'before-and-after', then also select time-series/temporal 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ii. If looking at different regions/geographic units, then also select geographic 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Individual => go to next question

4. Is there a control comparison group?
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. No => Case study (individual) or case series (multiple)
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Yes => go to next question

5. Exposure and outcome?
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. Are assessed simultaneously => Cross-sectional
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp b. Study participants are selected based on outcome and then exposure is assessed retrospectively => Case-control
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp c. Study participants are selected (may/may not be based on exposure) and then outcomes are tracked over time => Cohort-study
