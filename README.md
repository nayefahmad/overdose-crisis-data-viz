# Overdose crisis data visualization 

2020-04-10

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an interactive online visualization tool to allow users to understand the various legal, health, and social policies internationally that have been taken to address the overdose crisis. 

The project is based on the work of a research team led by Dr. Jane Buxton, Professor of the School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia (UBC) and Medical Director of Harm Reduction, BC Centre for Disease Control. The research team conducted the literature search, data extraction, and data analysis. 

The resuls of the work can be explored on [this interactive website](https://meenrz.shinyapps.io/overdose-crisis-data-viz_shiny-app/_w_b9597691/_w_2401cab7/). The code for building the interactive visualization is hosted in a separate repository, [here](https://github.com/nayefahmad/overdose-crisis-data-viz_shiny-app)
